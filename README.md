### Team Name:

Travile



## Proposed Level of Achievement:

Project Apollo 11

<br>

## Motivation:

Traveling and exploring new places is a great way to de-stress and make new memories. But the fickle human brain can hardly be trusted to keep those memories safe. Maintaining a travel journal is a great way to keep those moments frozen in time, to look back on and reminisce whenever we want. But physical journals can be troublesome to keep track of, and sometimes, just finding the entry you’re looking for can take ages, especially if you’re a frequent traveler. Therefore we want to make an app that allows people to document&nbsp;**digital journals** and to keep track of the precious moments in their travels and share them with like-minded people. We believe that our app can provide a cost effective way of journaling their adventures and experience and also include photographs in a very user-friendly manner. Thus, our app allows you to recreate those moments you lived with your loved ones and let them be a part of your journey.

<br>

## Aim:

Our goal is to provide a reliable and intuitive platform for travelers to record their journals and share it with like-minded communities. It will also let them view fellow traveler’s journals and plan their itinerary accordingly.&nbsp;

## How Are We Different From Existing Platforms?

Our app combines useful features from a variety of traveling apps and beyond. It allows both journaling and sharing, easily and without hassle. It allows travelers to follow other travelers and take inspiration from their traveling journeys… a social networking app specifically for travelers. It also allows easy journaling and

## Project Scope:

The scope of our project can be classified into three categories - Setup, Core and Extensions

1. **Setup** - User Signup and Signin 
2. **Core** (Interface design mockups on the last page)
   - Homepage containing a list of all the trips of the user and a short summary
   - Each trip will lead to a timeline of the visited location
   - Each location will lead to the page where user can write their journal and add photographs
   - Users can filter their trips on the basis of time and location
   - A map accessible from the home page marking the places visited by the user with dates and can be zoomed in or out
3. **Extensions** (good to have)
   - A public user profile page with the names of the place user visited
   - see and follow the profiles of fellow users with public profile
   - search for trips or journals of fellow users by location or name o user
   - random trips in explore page
   - customizable font, color, and arrangement of the journal
   - Share journal entries and make shared journal entries
   - A wish list and accessible from the profile
   - Commenting and liking other posts

### Feature Limitations / Constraints

Orbital is a 3 months programme, and both of us had been traveling a lot during these three months. We were both thousands of km away and we could not always maintain communication. As a result, there were many features that we were unable to implement. Below are some of the features we would like to implement in the future.

<br>

## What next? (TODO)

- Implement search by date
- Allow users to navigate from other’s trip or location pages to their profile pages
- Show wishlist
- Sync locations to map
- Add image in profile, trips and locations
- Allow users to like and comment on other people’s trips
- Allow users to edit their own profile and add bio and profile pic
- Allow users to view random trips in explore
- Make tiles extensible and add summaries
- Change format of the location tiles to a timeline
- Allow users to share profiles and make shared trips
- Implement it in various devices and make website

<br>

## Software Engineering Practices

1. #### Made code readable and understandable
   
   We tried our best to make the code readable and understandable. We tried to make the code clean and well indented. We made the code logically structured using modules and functions. Using modules was really important in making the flow of pages in explore, profile and home: from list of profiles (in case of explore) to the list of trips to the list of locations and to the location journal itself.

2. #### Optimized time and space
   
   The time and memory taken by each operation was a major factor in deciding how the operations are done. The best example of this is when we changed the data structure to root level collections to avoid getting more data then we need.
   
   Old data structure:
   
   ```
   /
   └── Users
       ├── User 1
       │   ├── trips
       │   │   └── locations
       │   │       ├── location 1
       │   │       └── location 2
       │   ├── username
       │   ├── followers
       │   └── following
       │       └── User 2
       └── User 2
           ├── trips
           │   └── locations
           │       ├── location 1
           │       └── location 2
           ├── username
           ├── followers
           └── following
   ```
   
   New data structure:
   
   ```
   /
   ├── Trips
   │   ├── User 1
   │   │   ├── trip 1
   │   │   └── trip 2
   │   └── User 2
   │       └── trip 1
   ├── Profiles
   ├── Locations
   │   ├── User 1
   │   │   ├── trip 1
   │   │   │   └── location 1
   │   │   └── trip 2
   │   └── User 2
   │       └── trip 1
   │           ├── location 1
   │           └── location 2
   ├── Followers
   │   └── User 2
   │       └── User 1
   └── Following
       └── User 1
            └── User 2
   ```
   
   Not only does the new structure make it easier to retrieve only the relevant data and save storage, it also makes getting collective much easier.

3. #### Refactored code
   
   We often made changes to the structure of the code without changing the functionality of it. A lot of our github commits just moved the files around to enhance the readability of the code and to make finding things easier. Widgets like the tiles and the profile and location pages were refactored out since and reused again and again. This way, if we wanted to add new functionality in, for example, the location page, we only had to edit once.

4. #### Used good coding conventions
   
   We used descriptive names and good indentation. We also followed a fixed style for naming (All files are in the format abc_def.dart, classes are AbcDef, and methods are abcDef) to make it easier to remember and to maintain some uniformity.

5. #### Communication
   
   Since we were thousands of kms apart physically and we were both traveling a lot, communication became an important aspect of this project. We used telegram to keep in touch and used zoom calls whenever possible to solve issues together.

6. #### Avoided repetition
   
   We avoided writing repetitive code by separating out the code that was being used repetitively and putting it in the constants file, so we could access it easily.

7. #### Git Version Control:
   
   We used git for version control. It allowed us to keep track of our changes and roll back to the previous version if we wanted to get rid of some changes, or some bugs popped up.
   
   1. Branching
      
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35413456/207224110-363220cd-9164-49d0-a0b7-fd5fff696bc2.png)
      
      Creating separate branches allowed us to develop features, fix bugs and to safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of our repository.
   
   2. Pull requests
      
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35413456/207224271-dd88a2dc-f1f8-431b-bc48-e618d676d471.png)
      
      Pull requests helped us tell each other about changes we have pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. We could review the potential changes and add follow-up commits before the changes are merged to the main branch.
   
   3. Issues
      
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35413456/207224323-10d47b2f-f8c7-487a-a00f-1d80b5431d1e.png)
      
      We used github issues to keep track of the things we need to do, and divide the tasks amongst ourselves

This activity diagram represents the behavior of the user. 

- Upon registration, a registered user can navigate to the Home Page and can access the Map Page, Explore Page and Profile Page.
- The Map Page shows the dated location of the travelers marked. Users can access the trip summary through the marked locations. 
- The Explore Page lets the user view the posts of other users and search for posts of other users.
- The Profile Page will let the user view the number of posts, followers and following. They can also update their personalized profile pic and view their own journal.
- From the home page the user can add a new trip with date
