**README**

**Team Name:**

Travile

**Proposed Level of Achievement:**

Project Apollo 11

**Motivation:**

Traveling and exploring new places is a great way to de-stress and make
new memories. But the fickle human brain can hardly be trusted to keep
those memories safe. Maintaining a travel journal is a great way to keep
those moments frozen in time, to look back on and reminisce whenever we
want. But physical journals can be troublesome to keep track of, and
sometimes, just finding the entry you’re looking for can take ages,
especially if you’re a frequent traveler. Therefore we want to make an
app that allows people to document **digital journals** and to keep
track of the precious moments in their travels and share them with
like-minded people. We believe that our app can provide a cost effective
way of journaling their adventures and experience and also include
photographs in a very user-friendly manner. Thus, our app allows you to
recreate those moments you lived with your loved ones and let them be a
part of your journey.

**Aim:**

Our goal is to provide a reliable and intuitive platform for travelers
to record their journals and share it with like-minded communities. It
will also let them view fellow traveler’s journals and plan their
itinerary accordingly.

**Feature Limitations / Constraints**

Orbital is a 3 months programme, and both of us had been traveling a lot
during these three months. We were both thousands of km away and we
could not always maintain communication. As a result, there were many
features that we were unable to implement. Below are some of the
features we would like to implement in the future.

**What next? (TODO)**

-   Implement search by date

-   Allow users to navigate from other’s trip or location pages to their
    > profile pages

-   Show wishlist

-   Sync locations to map

-   Add image in profile, trips and locations

-   Allow users to like and comment on other people’s trips

-   Allow users to edit their own profile and add bio and profile pic

-   Allow users to view random trips in explore

-   Make tiles extensible and add summaries

-   Change format of the location tiles to a timeline

-   Allow users to share profiles and make shared trips

-   Implement it in various devices and make website

**Software Engineering Practices**

1.  **Made code readable and understandable**

> We tried our best to make the code readable and understandable. We
> tried to make the code clean and well indented. We made the code
> logically structured using modules and functions. Using modules was
> really important in making the flow of pages in explore, profile and
> home: from list of profiles (in case of explore) to the list of trips
> to the list of locations and to the location journal itself.

1.  **Optimized time and space**

> The time and memory taken by each operation was a major factor in
> deciding how the operations are done. The best example of this is when
> we changed the data structure to root level collections to avoid
> getting more data then we need.
>
> Old data structure: / -&gt; Users -&gt; User 1 -&gt; trips -&gt;
> locations -&gt; location 1
>
> -&gt; location 2
>
> -&gt; username
>
> -&gt; followers
>
> -&gt; following -&gt; User 2
>
> -&gt; User 2 -&gt; trips -&gt; locations -&gt; location 1
>
> -&gt; location 2
>
> -&gt; username

> -&gt; followers -&gt; User 1

> New data structure: / -&gt; Trips -&gt; User 1 -&gt; trip 1
>
> -&gt; trip 2
>
> -&gt; User 2 -&gt; trip 1
>
> -&gt; Profiles

> -&gt; Following -&gt; User 1 -&gt; User 2

> Not only does the new structure make it easier to retrieve only the
> relevant data and save storage, it also makes getting collective much
> easier.

1.  **Refactored code**

> We often made changes to the structure of the code without changing
> the functionality of it. A lot of our github commits just moved the
> files around to enhance the readability of the code and to make
> finding things easier. Widgets like the tiles and the profile and
> location pages were refactored out since and reused again and again.
> This way, if we wanted to add new functionality in, for example, the
> location page, we only had to edit once.

1.  **Used good coding conventions**

> We used descriptive names and good indentation. We also followed a
> fixed style for naming (All files are in the format abc\_def.dart,
> classes are AbcDef, and methods are abcDef) to make it easier to
> remember and to maintain some uniformity.

1.  **Communication**

> Since we were thousands of kms apart physically and we were both
> traveling a lot, communication became an important aspect of this
> project. We used telegram to keep in touch and used zoom calls
> whenever possible to solve issues together.

1.  **Avoided repetition**

> We avoided writing repetitive code by separating out the code that was
> being used repetitively and putting it in the constants file, so we
> could access it easily.

1.  **Git Version Control:**

> We used git for version control. It allowed us to keep track of our
> changes and roll back to the previous version if we wanted to get rid
> of some changes, or some bugs popped up.

1.  Branching![](media/image1.png){width="6.363141951006124in"
    > height="2.5276891951006126in"}Creating separate branches allowed
    > us to develop features, fix bugs and to safely experiment with new
    > ideas in a contained area of our repository.

2.  Pull requests

>
> Pull requests helped us tell each other about changes we have pushed
> to a branch in a repository on GitHub. We could review the potential
> changes and add follow-up commits before the changes are merged to the
> main branch.

1.  Issues

> ![](media/image26.png){width="6.361054243219598in"
> height="3.2656255468066493in"}We used github issues to keep track of
> the things we need to do, and divide the tasks amongst ourselves

This activity diagram represents the behavior of the user.

-   Upon registration, a registered user can navigate to the Home Page
    > and can access the Map Page, Explore Page and Profile Page.

-   The Map Page shows the dated location of the travelers marked. Users
    > can access the trip summary through the marked locations.

-   The Explore Page lets the user view the posts of other users and
    > search for posts of other users.

-   The Profile Page will let the user view the number of posts,
    > followers and following. They can also update their personalized
    > profile pic and view their own journal.

-   From the home page the user can add a new trip with date

  2.       Watched tutorials for making social media app                                          28 Jun - 5 Jun 2022    5               0                Found a tutorial online that made an entire social media app. Scoured the tutorials to find things to add to the app

  3.       Added constants for primary colors used in app                                         5 July                 0               3                Added constants for the colors and replaced the new constants everywhere in the code.

  4.       Cleaning code and making the UI easier to work with                                    6 Jul - 9 Jul 2022     10              0                Changed the icons, buttons and formatting in the trip editing page

  5.       Adding images to profile page                                                          6 Jul - 10 Jul 2022    0               20               This feature is still buggy and we faced lot of run time errors while trying to add edit image option.

  6.       Fixed some bugs in updating and post                                                   10 Jul                 4               0                The update changed the data entirely instead of just updating the field, making bugs appear.

  7.       Got the public trips, the public locations and the journals visible in profile page    10 Jul - 18 Jul        37              0

In the process of fixing these bugs, we learnt a lot about flutter widgets. This knowledge helped a lot when we got similar while building explore page
